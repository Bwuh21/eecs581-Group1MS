A Minesweeper game implementation built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of a Software Engineering course project.

> **Project Status:** ðŸš§ Under Development  
> This is an educational project for EECS 581 - Software Engineering 2.

---

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features
- Basic HTML structure with 8x8 grid layout
- CSS Grid-based game board styling
- Basic Game class structure
- Static button elements for each cell

### ðŸš§ In Progress / TODO
- Game logic implementation
- Mine placement algorithm
- Cell reveal functionality
- Flag placement (right-click)
- Win/lose detection
- Timer and mine counter
- Game reset functionality

---

## Quick Start

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Currently displays a static 8x8 grid (game logic not yet implemented)

## Project Structure

```text
.
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main HTML file with game board
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css          # CSS styling for the game
â”œâ”€â”€ game/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ game.js        # JavaScript game logic (basic structure)
â””â”€â”€ README.md          # This file
```

## Development Notes

- The project uses vanilla JavaScript with no external dependencies
- Grid layout is currently hardcoded as 8x8 in the HTML
- Game class exists but methods are not yet implemented
- CSS uses a simple grid layout with basic button styling

---

## Future Enhancements

Once core functionality is complete, potential improvements include:
- Configurable board sizes and difficulty levels
- Better visual styling and animations
- High score tracking
- Keyboard navigation support
- Mobile-responsive design improvements
